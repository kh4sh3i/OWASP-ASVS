# OWASP ASVS
The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is a comprehensive framework aimed at establishing security requirements for web applications and services.


## Structure of ASVS
ASVS is organized into three verification levels, each increasing in depth and complexity:

* Level 1: Basic security controls applicable to all software.

* Level 2: Enhanced controls for applications handling sensitive data, requiring a higher level of trust.

* Level 3: Comprehensive security controls for applications that require the highest assurance level, typically involving critical data or high-risk environments.


## Key Areas Covered
The ASVS consists of 14 chapters, each focusing on specific aspects of application security. Here are some key areas included in the checklist:
```
Authentication: Ensures secure user authentication processes.

Access Control: Verifies that users have appropriate permissions and that unauthorized access is prevented.

Data Protection: Focuses on securing sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

API Security: Addresses security measures specific to application programming interfaces.

Configuration Hardening: Ensures that applications are securely configured to minimize vulnerabilities.

Threat Modeling: Guides the identification and mitigation of potential threats during the development process.

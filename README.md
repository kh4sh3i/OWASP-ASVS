# OWASP ASVS
The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is a comprehensive framework aimed at establishing security requirements for web applications and services.


## Structure of ASVS
ASVS is organized into three verification levels, each increasing in depth and complexity:

* Level 1: Basic security controls applicable to all software.

* Level 2: Enhanced controls for applications handling sensitive data, requiring a higher level of trust.

* Level 3: Comprehensive security controls for applications that require the highest assurance level, typically involving critical data or high-risk environments.


## Key Areas Covered
The ASVS consists of 14 chapters, each focusing on specific aspects of application security. Here are some key areas included in the checklist:
```
Authentication: Ensures secure user authentication processes.
Access Control: Verifies that users have appropriate permissions and that unauthorized access is prevented.
Data Protection: Focuses on securing sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
API Security: Addresses security measures specific to application programming interfaces.
Configuration Hardening: Ensures that applications are securely configured to minimize vulnerabilities.
Threat Modeling: Guides the identification and mitigation of potential threats during the development process.
```

## OWASP ASVS checklist for audits
* This checklist is compatible with ASVS version 4.0.3 
* you can display a summary graph on the Project by download [asvs_checklist.xlsx](https://github.com/kh4sh3i/OWASP-ASVS/blob/main/asvs_checklist.xlsx)

## Tips:
use [DefectDojo](https://github.com/kh4sh3i/DefectDojo) for make asvs systematic with update on every project !
we can use defectdojo benchmark for checking ASVS
